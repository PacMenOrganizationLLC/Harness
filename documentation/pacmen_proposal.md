**Culture**
- Team
  - Tuesday 1:30-3:30pm
  - Friday 11:30am-1:30pm
  - Activities/Tasks
    - Review assignments, updates, and feature requests
      - Can request features anytime via teams or word of mouth. Approve/deny requests during team meeting.
        - If approved, add to backlog
    - Plan and design features/organization
    - Set goals
    - Delegate tasks

  - Weekly Scrum meeting on Tuesdays
    - Tuesday - weekly standup lead by SM to review the previous week's goals and task. SM assigns new ones to accomplish within the next 7 days.
    - Friday - review progress on tasks/goals and resolve blocks
    - Finishing tasks early - ask team members if they need help. If they don't, ask the SM what other tasks on the backlog you should do.
  - Sprint length of 1 week
  - A story is a description of a feature or bug and how it benefits the user. A story is in progress when it gets assigned to a user, in review when a pull request has been made, and complete when a pull request has been reviewed and merged into the master branch. Update backlog as it moves.
  - Swap scrum master every week (alphabetical first name)
  - In case of individual abscence, spend 2 hours working individually. It is your responsibility to get the rundown of events from someone else. 
- Subteam
  - As needed to resolve specific issues, train/teach technology, etc.
- Individual
  - Minimum of 2 hours between class time (4 hours a week)
  - Additional 4 hours of work a week
- Github
  - Work on individual branches
  - Pull requests: We will utilize Trunk-based development and merge small, frequent updates to the core “trunk”/main branch. Merge as often as possible with tests passing and code compiling. If you make a request that doesn't compile you must bring snacks to the next team meeting.
  - Merging pull requests: someone else must review and merge your request.
  - Backlog: setup and manage tasks, todo list, story points, etc.
    - Columns: To Do, In Progress, Blocked, Review, Done
- Testing
  - Test backend
  - Practice TDD for non-CRUD features
  - Present different wireframes to stakeholders for frontend testing.
- Resolutions
  - Major feature disagreements can be built in different branches to later be reviewed by everyone where a final decision will be made. If a decision cannot be made, Heber has final say.
  - Small feature disagreements to be resolved via vote. If tie, scrum master counts as 2 votes. Vote is final unless a later, unanimous vote to revote.
- Roles
  - Bridger: Merge resolution expert
  - Josh: Wordsmith
  - Anthony: R&D expert
  - Ethan: Documentor
- Goals - set SMART goals
  - As a team during our team meeting, review goals, create new ones, etc.
  - A goal must have a timeline, specific features/stories associated, responsibility (individual, subteam, team)
