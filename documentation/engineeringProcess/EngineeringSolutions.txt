Problem: How will our API communicate with the game to start, stop, etc

Options:
- Force Game to provide a specific controller with certain endpoints, and we're given a base address
    - Pros: 
        - Consistency in results
    - Cons:
        - Dictates the structure of their controllers
- Force Games to support certain endpoints, we're given the base address and the controller
    - Pros: 
        - Allows User flexibility in designing the endpoints
    - Cons:
        - Requires concatinating the API call
- Admin specifies endpoints when they add the game
    - Pros: 
        - Less chance for error
    - Cons:
        - The admin may not have that information when adding the game
- Get Endpoints at runtime
    - Pros: 
        - Don't have to store the endpoints
    - Cons:
        - Can't check beforehand if the game is compatible
