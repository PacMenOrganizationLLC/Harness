  - Delegate tasks
  - Troubleshoot
  - Set goals
  - Q&A
  - R&D
- Subteam
  - Up to individuals for when and what they work on to coordinate
  - Maximum flexibility

**Leadership Plan**
- Roles
  - Bridger: Merge resolution expert
  - Josh: Wordsmith (notetaker)
  - Anthony: R&D expert
  - Ethan: Documentor
- Frequency of taking turns: 10min intervals (alphabetically by first name)

**Team rules for having an inclusive environment**
- Discuss recommendations (new features, plans, designs, etc) as a team
  - Can propose them throughout the week via teams to be reviewed during team meeting
- Everyone's opinon matters
- Resolutions
  - Major feature disagreements can be built in different branches to later be reviewed by everyone where a final decision will be made. If a decision cannot be made, Heber has final say.
  - Small feature disagreements to be resolved via vote. If tie, scrum master counts as 2 votes. Vote is final unless a later, unanimous vote to revote.

  **Team's procedures for setting goals and measuring accomplishments**
  - Goals - set SMART goals
    - As a team during our team meeting, review goals, create new ones, etc.
    - A goal must have a timeline, specific features/stories associated, responsibility (individual, subteam, team)
  - A story is a description of a feature or bug and how it benefits the user. A story is in progress when it gets assigned to a user, in review when a pull request has been made, and complete when a pull request has been reviewed and merged into the master branch. Update backlog as it moves.

  **Team's SDLC methods**
  - Scrum:
    - Sprint length of 1 week
    - Switch SM each week
    - Scrum Master responsibilities:
      - Lead weekly standup
      - Assign tasks/stories
      - Make sure everyone feels heard and understands their responsibilites
      - Work with individuals to understand their needs and abilities
      - Setup meetings with stakeholders and other individuals as needed
- Team's rules for planning tasks: Plan features and high level goals during team meeting
  - Subteams or individuals then break those down into specifics as they are assigned related tasks/stories
- Team's rules for marking a task as done
  - Someone else must review your pull request before merging into master
    - It is the responsibility of the person making the pull request to notify a team member that it needs review
  - A story is in progress when it gets assigned to a user, in review when a pull request has been made, and complete when a pull request has been reviewed and merged into the master branch.
  - Individuals can mark their task as complete
    - Review completed tasks during team meetings
- Branch Protocols:
  - We will utilize Trunk-based development and merge small, frequent updates to the core “trunk”/main branch. Merge as often as possible with tests passing and code compiling. If you make a request that doesn't compile you must bring snacks to the next team meeting.
- Demonstration to users:
  - Schedule interviews with Heber and Jonathan (main faculty stakeholders) to get requirements gathering, review progress, etc.
  - Present different wireframes to stakeholders.
  - Review notes taken by offical notetaker during team meeting
